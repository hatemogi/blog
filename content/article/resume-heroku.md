title: resume to heroku
---

I'm a software developer currently working at [Daum Communications](http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=035720.KQ) which is located in Seoul, Korea. I'm applying for the job position of "Erlang Infrastructure Developer" at Heroku. 

I've been admired technically superior companies, and I believe that Heroku is the one. And cloud computing architecture is certainly changing the web development/service/business platform entirely. And also, I'm interested and getting passionate about Erlang solutions. These reasons made me have a courage to send an application to the position. 

Several months earlier, I attended [ErlangFactory SF Bay Area 2011](http://erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2011) conference and Erlang/OTP express course. Although attending a Erlang conference/course doesn't mean having strong strength at Erlang, it might be a sign for having passion of Erlang. I couldn't say my Erlang experience is strong, but other skills listed for the position (Ruby, EventMachine, Redis, UNIX, and PostgreSQL) would be strong.

Here is [my Github account](https://github.com/hatemogi). There are source files for [Google Codejam 2011](http://code.google.com/codejam/). I passed its Qualification Round using several different programming languages (including Erlang and Ruby) for fun. Here's [my record](http://www.go-hero.net/jam/11/name/hatemogi) and the [source files](https://github.com/hatemogi/gcj_practice/tree/master/2011/QR).

And [this project]([https://github.com/hatemogi/xkobo) is an open-source game that I've fixed a little for OSX. 
 
And as a hobby, I designed and developed an embedded system controlling a toy R/C car. I designed the embedded system itself and programmed its firmware. And the embedded system is controlled by my custom iPhone app. [My demo video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaR-PHZVWMM) is on YouTube. I hope it shows that I'm also skilled at wide-range of programming.

Keywords on work experiences: Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, EventMachine, Objective-C, Java, Spring Framework, Linux, Prototype.js, Redis, Beanstalkd, and Nginx module development.

Keywords on personal interests: Erlang/OTP, Riak, WebMachine, AWS, CoffeeScript, ARM Cortex-M3, and LLVM.

If this application triggers any little interest, please let me know and allow me to send full resume.
